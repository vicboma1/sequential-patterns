Classic Game Loop
==================

This is the classic game loop.
The problem with it is you have no control over how fast time the game runs.
If you have a bad machine, the game will not working...
If you load a part of the game where there are heavy content (IA/Physics/Resources ...), you will play slower.
If you have a fast machine, the acts will be too fast..
