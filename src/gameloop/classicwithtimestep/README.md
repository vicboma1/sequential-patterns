Classic Game Loop with Time Step
==================

This is the classic game loop with Time Step and Maximum FPS fixed.

Using a constant game speed with a maximum FPS is a solution that is easy to implement and keeps the game code simple. 

But there are still some problems: 
* Defining a high FPS can still pose problems on slow hardware (but not as severe as the first solution), 
and defining a low FPS will waste visual appeal on fast hardware.
